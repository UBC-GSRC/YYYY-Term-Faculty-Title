# Reference Procedure:  

- The Reference Papers page is to make it easy for everybody to access the same articles.  

- If possible, include the PDF in the notebook so that others do not need to search the web for it.  

- Always use the date for each entry and tag your initials (YYYY-MM-DD AF)  

- Always put a new entry at the top of the page so you can see the newest work first  

- Do not use this as a default daily log. This page should describe updates at a higher level than the log.  

- Do not delete entries, this is meant to serve as a rudimentary version control and archive.  

- Leave the Procedure at the top of the page.
